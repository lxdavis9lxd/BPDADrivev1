# API Key Integration Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Added the API key `aaa96136-492f-4435-8177-714d8d64cf93` to the `.env` file
   - Configured API key to be loaded from environment variables in the API configuration

2. **API Client Configuration**
   - Modified `api.config.js` to include the API key in all requests
   - Added API key to default headers in the axios instance
   - Ensured the key is consistently applied in all API calls

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Created comprehensive test suite to verify API key integration:
     - `api.test.js`: Tests API configuration and basic API key loading
     - `api-key-validation.test.js`: Validates API key format and existence
     - `api-simple.test.js`: Simple live API test that can be used for verification
     - `api-live.test.js`: Full live API tests for all endpoints

4. **Test Script**
   - Enhanced `test-api.sh` to verify API key is set and properly formatted
   - Added check to make sure .env file exists
   - Improved test reporting and error handling

## Testing Strategy

Our testing approach ensures the API key is:

1. **Correctly Loaded**: We verify the API key is loaded from the .env file
2. **Properly Formatted**: We check that the API key matches the expected UUID format
3. **Included in Headers**: We test that the API key is correctly added to request headers
4. **Consistently Applied**: We verify all service functions include the API key
5. **Works with Live API**: We provide tests to validate the API key works with the actual API

## API Key Usage

The API key (`aaa96136-492f-4435-8177-714d8d64cf93`) is included in every API request as a header:
```
X-API-Key: aaa96136-492f-4435-8177-714d8d64cf93
```

This ensures all API calls are authorized and can access the necessary endpoints. The implementation in `api.config.js` guarantees the API key is consistently applied across all services without requiring manual addition in each API call.

## Verification Steps

To verify the API key integration:

1. Run the test script: `./test-api.sh`
2. Check that all API configuration and validation tests pass
3. For full verification, run the live API tests (requires network connectivity)

## Future Improvements

1. Add API key rotation capability
2. Implement more robust error handling for API key failures
3. Add monitoring for API key usage and rate limiting
4. Enhance security by storing the API key in a more secure location
